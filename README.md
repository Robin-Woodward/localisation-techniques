# localisation-techniques
Final year project for BEng in Robotics &amp; Mechatronics

Robots are increasingly operating autonomously in environments which
are unknown and dynamic. A robot uses a localisation technique and
mapping to generate 3D reconstruction of its surrounding. The
localisation technique provides the robot with the ability to establish its
position and orientation (pose) with respect to the environment.
Knowledge of the robot’s own location is essential to making decisions
about future actions. The technique must also provide fast and reliable
information so that the robot’s control unit can steer the robot along
required trajectories. The project aims to investigate various localisation
techniques which can be classified into two main categories. These are
relative localisation and absolute localisation. The former evaluates the
robot’s pose using information provided by various on-board sensors
(e.g. encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers) while the latter obtains the
absolute pose using beacons, landmarks or satellite based signals (e.g.
GPS).
